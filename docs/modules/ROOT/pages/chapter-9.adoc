[[sec-9-1]]
== 9.1 How to Approach Your Study Plan

Success on the AI-900 exam begins long before you sit down at the testing screen. A well-organized study plan turns a broad set of topics into a manageable sequence of focused sessions.

=== 9.1.1 Estimating Your Study Time

The amount of preparation you need depends on your starting point. Use the table below as a rough guide:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Experience Level |Recommended Study Hours |Suggested Timeline
|*New to AI and cloud computing* |15–20 hours |3–4 weeks
|*Some exposure to AI concepts or Azure* |10–15 hours |2–3 weeks
|*Working knowledge of AI and Azure services* |5–10 hours |1–2 weeks
|===

These estimates assume focused, active study — not passive reading. If your study sessions involve hands-on exercises, practice questions, and self-testing, you will retain more in fewer hours than if you simply re-read notes.

=== 9.1.2 Allocating Time by Domain Weight

.Figure 9.4: Study Time Allocation by Domain
image::ch9/visual_9_4_study_time_allocation.png[Proportional chart showing recommended study time by exam domain weight,width=85%]


As discussed in xref:chapter-1.adoc#ch-1[Chapter 1] (Introduction to the AI-900 Exam), the exam is organized into five content domains, each with an assigned percentage weight. Your study schedule should reflect these proportions. The domain with the highest weight — Machine Learning Principles on Azure at 20–25% — deserves the largest share of your preparation time. However, neglecting a lower-weight domain is risky; even a 15% domain represents several questions that could determine whether you pass or fail.

[TIP]
====
Before you begin studying, print or bookmark the official AI-900 exam skills outline from Microsoft Learn. Read through it completely. Then, rate your own confidence in each topic on a 1–5 scale. Spend the most time on topics where the combination of exam weight and low personal confidence is greatest.
====


=== 9.1.3 Building a Study Schedule

.Figure 9.12: Three-Week Study Schedule
image::ch9/visual_9_12_study_schedule.png[Calendar timeline showing chapter assignments mapped across three weeks of study,width=85%]


A concrete schedule keeps your preparation on track. Consider this sample plan for a candidate with moderate experience:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Week |Focus Area |Activities
|*Week 1* |AI Workloads and Responsible AI; Machine Learning on Azure |Read course materials (Chapters 2–4: Azure AI Services, AI Workloads, Machine Learning), complete Microsoft Learn modules, take notes
|*Week 2* |Computer Vision; Natural Language Processing |Read course materials (Chapters 5–7: Azure ML, Computer Vision, NLP), work through hands-on sandboxes, create flashcards for key terms
|*Week 3* |Generative AI; Review and Practice |Read course materials (xref:chapter-8.adoc#ch-8[Chapter 8]: Generative AI), take full-length practice assessments, review weak areas
|*Final Days* |Targeted Review |Re-test on missed questions, review glossary terms from <<ch-9,Chapter 9>> (this chapter), do a timed practice run
|===

.Reflection
****
Look at your own calendar for the next few weeks. Where can you realistically schedule focused study blocks? Marking specific times — rather than vaguely planning to "`study this weekend`" — significantly increases follow-through.

[[sec-9-2]]
== 9.2 Navigating the Exam Interface

.Figure 9.1: Microsoft Certification Exam Interface
image::ch9/visual_9_1_exam_interface.png[Annotated wireframe of exam screen showing question area; progress indicator; timer; and navigation controls,width=85%]


Understanding the exam environment before test day reduces anxiety and lets you focus entirely on the questions. Microsoft certification exams delivered through Pearson VUE share a consistent interface layout.

=== 9.2.1 Screen Layout

When you begin the exam, you will see several key elements:

* *Question area (center):* Each question appears here with its answer options.
* *Progress indicator (top):* Shows how many questions you have completed out of the total.
* *Timer (top):* Displays remaining time. The clock counts down from 45 minutes.
* *Navigation controls (bottom):* Buttons to move to the next question, go back to a previous question (when permitted), or mark a question for later review.
* *Accessibility options (side):* Options to adjust color contrast, text size, or request a break.

Accessibility accommodations — including extended time, screen magnification, and screen reader support — can be requested through Pearson VUE or Certiport when scheduling your exam. These must be arranged in advance with supporting documentation. The on-screen accessibility options provide supplemental adjustments during the exam itself.

=== 9.2.2 Question Types

The AI-900 uses several question formats. Familiarity with each type prevents wasted time figuring out mechanics during the exam.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Question Type |Description |Approach
|*Multiple choice (single answer)* |Select one correct answer from four options |Read all options before selecting; eliminate obviously wrong answers first
|*Multiple choice (multiple answers)* |Select two or more correct answers; the question specifies how many |Note exactly how many answers are required; partial credit may not be given
|*Drag-and-drop* |Match items from one list to another, or arrange items in order |Read the full scenario before dragging anything; check the order after placing all items
|*Hot area (click-on-image)* |Click on a specific region of a diagram or screenshot |Look carefully at all labeled regions; the correct click target may be small
|*Yes/No statement sets* |Evaluate several statements as true or false |Treat each statement independently; one wrong answer in the set does not mean all are wrong
|===

.Definition: Review Flag
****
A feature in the exam interface that allows you to mark a question so you can easily return to it later. Flagging a question does not change your answer — it simply bookmarks the question for a second review pass.
****



[[sec-9-3]]
== 9.3 Time Management During the Exam

With 40–60 questions and 45 minutes on the clock, effective pacing is essential. (Exam format details are subject to change. Verify the current question count and time allotment on the official AI-900 exam page at Microsoft Learn before your exam.) On average, you have roughly 45 seconds to one minute per question. Some questions will take only a few seconds; others may require careful analysis. The key is to avoid spending excessive time on any single question.

The AI-900 uses *scaled scoring*, with a passing threshold of 700 out of 1,000. Scaled scoring means that a score of 700 does not necessarily correspond to answering exactly 70% of questions correctly — Microsoft adjusts scores to account for variations in difficulty across different versions of the exam. Focus on understanding concepts thoroughly rather than aiming for a specific percentage of correct answers.

=== 9.3.1 The Two-Pass Strategy

.Figure 9.2: Two-Pass Strategy Flowchart
image::ch9/visual_9_2_two_pass_strategy.png[Decision flowchart showing first pass answering and flagging strategy followed by review pass,width=85%]


One of the most effective approaches is to work through the exam in two passes:

*First pass — Answer what you know.* Move through every question at a steady pace. If you know the answer confidently, select it and move on. If a question requires significant thought, make your best guess, flag it for review, and keep going. The goal is to reach the end of the exam quickly, banking all the "`easy`" points.

*Second pass — Revisit flagged questions.* After completing the first pass, return to flagged questions. You now have a clearer picture of how much time remains, and you can distribute that time among the questions that need it most.

=== 9.3.2 Pacing Checkpoints

.Figure 9.6: Exam Pacing Checkpoints Timeline
image::ch9/visual_9_6_pacing_checkpoints.png[45-minute timeline with three checkpoint markers at 15; 30; and 40 minutes,width=85%]


Use simple checkpoints to gauge your pace:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Checkpoint |Target
|After 15 minutes |Approximately one-third of questions completed
|After 30 minutes |Approximately two-thirds of questions completed
|After 40 minutes |All questions answered at least once; begin review pass
|===

If you fall behind these targets, speed up by relying more heavily on elimination and gut instinct for uncertain questions. An educated guess is always better than leaving a question unanswered, as there is no penalty for incorrect answers on the AI-900.

[TIP]
====
When taking practice exams, always use a timer. Practicing under timed conditions builds the pacing instincts you need on exam day. If you consistently run out of time during practice, focus on reducing deliberation time for questions where you are unsure.
====



[[sec-9-4]]
== 9.4 Reading Questions Carefully

Misreading a question is one of the most common — and most preventable — causes of lost points on any certification exam. The AI-900 is no exception.

=== 9.4.1 Watch for Negative Qualifiers

Words such as *not*, *except*, *least*, and *never* reverse the logic of a question. Consider the difference between these two questions:

* "`Which of the following *is* a principle of responsible AI?`"
* "`Which of the following *is not* a principle of responsible AI?`"

The first asks you to identify a correct principle. The second asks you to identify the one item that does _not_ belong. Missing a single word can lead you to choose the exact opposite of the correct answer.

=== 9.4.2 Identify What the Question Is Really Asking

Some questions contain a paragraph of context (a scenario) followed by the actual question in the last sentence. It is tempting to start forming an answer while reading the scenario, but the real question may ask something different from what you expected. Train yourself to:

[arabic]
. Read the entire question, including the final sentence, before looking at answer options.
. Mentally rephrase the question in your own words.
. Only then evaluate the answer choices.

=== 9.4.3 Keyword Spotting in Scenario Questions

.Figure 9.3: Keyword-to-Concept Mapping Reference
image::ch9/visual_9_3_keyword_mapping.png[Color-coded reference card mapping exam keywords to AI concepts by domain,width=85%]


Scenario-based questions describe a business situation and ask you to choose the most appropriate AI service or principle. Learning to spot keywords dramatically speeds up your ability to match scenarios to concepts.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Keyword or Phrase |Likely Concept
|"`bias,`" "`gender,`" "`ethnicity,`" "`equitable outcomes`" |Fairness (Responsible AI)
|"`understandable to users,`" "`explain decisions`" |Transparency (Responsible AI)
|"`personal data,`" "`data protection,`" "`encryption`" |Privacy and Security (Responsible AI)
|"`governance framework,`" "`audit trail`" |Accountability (Responsible AI)
|"`labeled data,`" "`historical outcomes,`" "`predict a number`" |Supervised Learning (Regression)
|"`categories,`" "`classify,`" "`spam detection`" |Supervised Learning (Classification)
|"`group similar items,`" "`no labeled data,`" "`patterns`" |Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
|"`identify objects with bounding boxes`" |Object Detection (Computer Vision)
|"`extract text from images,`" "`digitize documents`" |OCR (Computer Vision)
|"`analyze customer sentiment,`" "`positive or negative`" |Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
|"`translate between languages,`" "`multilingual`" |Translation Services (NLP)
|"`generate text,`" "`generate code,`" "`create images from descriptions`" |Generative AI
|"`set tone and constraints for the model`" |Prompt Engineering / System Messages
|===

.Reflection
****
Pick any three rows from the table above. For each one, write a short business scenario (two or three sentences) that would lead to that concept as the answer. Creating your own scenarios is one of the most effective ways to internalize keyword-to-concept mappings.
****



[[sec-9-5]]
== 9.5 Using the Process of Elimination

When you encounter a question where the correct answer does not immediately stand out, elimination is your most powerful tool.

=== 9.5.1 How Elimination Improves Your Odds

.Figure 9.5: Elimination Probability Improvement
image::ch9/visual_9_5_elimination_probability.png[Progressive bar chart showing probability improvement from 25% to 100% as answer choices are eliminated,width=70%]


On a standard four-option multiple-choice question, guessing randomly gives you a 25% chance of being correct. Each option you can confidently eliminate improves those odds:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Options Eliminated |Remaining Choices |Probability of Correct Guess
|0 |4 |25%
|1 |3 |33%
|2 |2 |50%
|3 |1 |100%
|===

Even eliminating a single option meaningfully improves your chances. On an exam where the pass/fail line is determined by a handful of questions, this technique can make a decisive difference.

=== 9.5.2 Common Elimination Clues

Look for these indicators that an answer option is likely wrong:

* *Absolute language:* Options containing words like "`always,`" "`never,`" or "`guarantees`" are often incorrect. Most AI systems involve probabilities and trade-offs, not absolutes.
* *Out-of-scope services:* If an option mentions a service or feature that belongs to a different Azure category than the one described in the scenario, it is probably wrong. For example, if the question is about analyzing images and one option is "`Azure AI Translator,`" you can safely eliminate it.
* *Retired features:* Microsoft has retired certain capabilities for ethical reasons (such as emotion detection in facial analysis). If an option relies on a retired feature as though it is currently available, eliminate it.
* *Wrong task type:* If the question describes a classification problem but one option describes a regression algorithm, that option does not fit.

[NOTE]
====
In test design, a _distractor_ is an incorrect answer option deliberately crafted to appear plausible. Distractors often contain real terminology used in a wrong context. Recognizing distractors is a skill that improves with practice.
====



[[sec-9-6]]
== 9.6 Domain-Specific Review Strategies

The AI-900 covers five major domains. Each domain has its own patterns of frequently tested concepts and common pitfalls. This section provides a focused review strategy for each.

=== 9.6.1 AI Fundamentals and Responsible AI

.Figure 9.10: Responsible AI Principles Quick Review
image::ch9/visual_9_10_responsible_ai_review.png[Six-card summary of responsible AI principles with exam keyword hints,width=85%]


Responsible AI principles appear throughout the exam, not just in the dedicated domain. Memorize all six principles and be prepared to identify which principle applies to a given scenario.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Principle |Core Idea |Exam Tip
|*Fairness* |AI systems should treat all groups of people equitably |Look for scenarios involving bias or demographic disparities
|*Reliability and Safety* |AI systems should perform consistently and safely |Look for scenarios about system failures or unpredictable behavior
|*Privacy and Security* |AI systems should protect data and respect privacy |Look for scenarios about data handling, storage, or access controls
|*Inclusiveness* |AI systems should engage and empower all people |Look for scenarios about accessibility and reaching diverse users
|*Transparency* |AI systems should be understandable |Look for scenarios about explaining model decisions to stakeholders
|*Accountability* |People should be responsible for AI systems |Look for scenarios about governance, oversight, and audit mechanisms
|===

Also review AI workload types. When a scenario describes making large volumes of data searchable, think knowledge mining. When it describes interactive conversation, think conversational AI. The exam tests your ability to match a business problem to the right category of AI solution.

=== 9.6.2 Machine Learning

.Figure 9.7: ML Type Decision Tree (Review)
image::ch9/visual_9_7_ml_decision_tree_review.png[Condensed decision tree for selecting regression; classification; or clustering,width=85%]


Key concepts to master:

* *Supervised vs. unsupervised learning:* Supervised learning uses labeled data; unsupervised learning discovers patterns without labels. Know the subtypes: regression (predicting continuous values), classification (predicting categories), and clustering (grouping similar items).
* *Features vs. labels:* Features are input variables; labels are the output variable you want to predict. Be able to identify which is which in a given scenario.
* *Model evaluation:* Know common metrics — R-squared for regression, accuracy and precision for classification. Understand overfitting (model performs well on training data but poorly on new data) and underfitting (model performs poorly on both).
* *Azure Machine Learning workflow:* The general sequence is: create a workspace, prepare data, split into training and validation sets, train the model, evaluate, and deploy. Questions may test whether you know the correct order of these steps.
* *Training vs. inference pipelines:* Training pipelines build the model; inference pipelines deploy it for predictions. Do not confuse the two.

.Definition: Overfitting
****
A condition in which a machine learning model learns the training data too precisely — including its noise and anomalies — resulting in strong training performance but poor performance on new, unseen data.
****


.Definition: Underfitting
****
A machine learning condition in which a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training data and new data. Underfitting typically occurs when the model has too few features, insufficient training time, or an overly simplistic algorithm.
****


[TIP]
====
Without looking back, can you name the three types of supervised learning tasks tested on the AI-900 (regression, classification, clustering — wait, which one is unsupervised?) and describe the key difference between overfitting and underfitting? Test yourself, then verify above.
====


=== 9.6.3 Computer Vision

.Figure 9.8: Computer Vision Task Quick Reference
image::ch9/visual_9_8_cv_quick_reference.png[Four small panels comparing classification; object detection; segmentation; and OCR tasks,width=85%]


Understand the distinctions between core tasks:

* *Image classification:* Determining what is in an image (e.g., "`this is a cat`").
* *Object detection:* Identifying and locating multiple objects within an image using bounding boxes.
* *Semantic segmentation:* Classifying every pixel in an image into a category.
* *OCR (Optical Character Recognition):* Extracting text from images. Know that OCR handles both printed and handwritten text, and that it is used for text extraction only — not for general image analysis or facial detection.
* *Facial detection vs. facial verification:* Detection finds faces in an image; verification confirms whether two faces belong to the same person. Note that emotion detection has been retired for ethical reasons.

=== 9.6.4 Natural Language Processing

.Figure 9.9: NLP Service-to-Task Quick Reference
image::ch9/visual_9_9_nlp_quick_reference.png[Three-column matching reference mapping NLP tasks to Azure services,width=85%]


Know which Azure service matches which NLP task:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Task |Service / Feature |What It Does
|Identify main topics |Key phrase extraction |Pulls out the most important phrases from text
|Detect positive or negative tone |Sentiment analysis |Scores text on a positive-to-negative scale
|Identify people, places, organizations |Named entity recognition (NER) |Labels entities by type
|Connect entities to a knowledge base |Entity linking |Goes beyond NER to disambiguate and link entities
|Detect what language text is written in |Language detection |Returns a language code and confidence score
|Convert speech to written text |Speech-to-text (Azure AI Speech) |Transcribes audio input
|Convert written text to spoken audio |Text-to-speech (Azure AI Speech) |Generates audio output from text
|Translate text between languages |Azure AI Translator |Handles text-to-text translation
|Translate spoken language in real time |Speech translation (Azure AI Speech) |Combines speech recognition with translation
|===

Remember: Azure AI Translator is for text. Azure AI Speech is for audio. Azure AI Custom Translator is for domain-specific terminology. The exam often tests whether you can pick the correct service based on the type of input and output described in a scenario.

[TIP]
====
A question describes a company analyzing customer emails to determine whether the overall tone is positive or negative. What NLP capability is being described, and which Azure service provides it? Try to answer before checking <<sec-9-6,Section 9.6.4>>.
====


=== 9.6.5 Generative AI

Focus on these key areas:

* *Model families:* GPT models generate and understand text and code. DALL-E generates images from text descriptions. Know which model fits which task — generating Python code is GPT, not DALL-E.
* *Copilots:* AI assistants embedded in applications that help users accomplish tasks using natural language. They are more than chatbots — they understand context and provide tailored assistance.
* *Prompt engineering:* The practice of crafting inputs to guide a model's output. System messages set the context, tone, and constraints. The exam may ask how to use system messages to control model behavior.
* *Content safety layers:* Responsible AI for generative models includes multiple protective layers: the model layer (built-in safety training), the safety system layer (content filtering), the metaprompt and grounding layer (setting context and boundaries), and the user experience layer (clear documentation and user guidance).

Note: This four-layer model is a conceptual framework from Microsoft Learn documentation. Exam questions typically test your understanding of the general concept — that multiple protective layers exist — rather than requiring recall of specific layer names.

[TIP]
====
For each of the five domains, write a one-page summary from memory — without looking at your notes. Then compare what you wrote to the course materials. The gaps you discover are exactly the areas that need additional review.
====



[[sec-9-7]]
== 9.7 Managing Stress and Maintaining Focus

Test anxiety can undermine even thorough preparation. Building a few simple habits into your exam-day routine helps you stay calm and think clearly.

=== 9.7.1 Before the Exam

* *Sleep:* Get a full night of sleep the night before. Cramming until 2 AM is counterproductive; sleep consolidates memory. If your schedule makes a full eight hours difficult — as is common for working professionals, caregivers, and students balancing multiple responsibilities — even a consistent six-hour sleep block improves memory consolidation compared to irregular or fragmented sleep.
* *Arrive early or log in early:* Whether you are testing at a center or online, give yourself at least 15 minutes of buffer time. Rushing to start the exam elevates stress before you answer a single question.
* *Eat and hydrate:* A light meal and water before the exam keeps your energy and concentration stable.

=== 9.7.2 During the Exam

* *Breathe:* If you encounter a difficult question or notice the timer moving faster than expected, pause for two or three slow, deep breaths. This activates the body's relaxation response and restores clear thinking.
* *Maintain momentum:* Do not dwell on a question you have already answered. Once you select an answer and move on, let it go. Ruminating about past questions steals focus from current ones.
* *Use the review pass wisely:* If you finish your first pass with time remaining, use those final minutes to revisit flagged questions. A fresh perspective often reveals the answer more clearly than prolonged initial deliberation.

=== 9.7.3 Changing Answers

Research on test-taking generally suggests that initial answers tend to be correct more often than changed answers, though individual results vary. The general guideline is:

* *Change an answer* if you have a clear, specific reason (e.g., you misread the question, or a later question jogged your memory about the correct concept).
* *Do not change an answer* based solely on vague doubt or second-guessing without new reasoning.

.Reflection
****
Think about past exams you have taken. Did you tend to run out of time, finish early, or pace yourself well? Did you change answers and regret it, or catch mistakes by reviewing? Understanding your own testing tendencies helps you apply the right strategies for this exam.
****


=== 9.7.4 Conducting a Productive Review Pass

If you finish your first pass with time remaining, use these guidelines for your review:

* *Prioritize flagged questions.* Review flagged questions first, since these are the ones where you were least confident.
* *Re-read the question stem carefully.* Many errors on review come from misreading — check for negative qualifiers (not, except, least) you may have missed.
* *Look for new information.* Later questions sometimes contain clues or context that help you answer earlier ones.
* *Apply the change-answer rule.* Only change an answer if you have a specific, articulable reason (you misread the question, you confused two terms, or another question triggered a clear memory). Do not change answers based on vague doubt.


[[sec-9-8]]
== 9.8 Final Preparation Checklist

.Figure 9.11: Final Preparation Checklist
image::ch9/visual_9_11_final_checklist.png[Professionally styled exam preparation checklist with checkbox icons,width=85%]


Use this checklist in the days before your exam. Mark each item as *Done*, *In Progress*, or *Not Yet* as you work through your final preparation.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Item |Status
|Reviewed the official AI-900 exam skills outline for any recent updates |
|Studied all five exam domains with time proportional to their weight |
|Completed at least one full-length timed practice assessment |
|Reviewed all key terms and definitions from Units 1–8 |
|Practiced keyword-spotting on scenario-based questions |
|Confirmed exam registration, date, time, and delivery method |
|Tested computer setup (if taking the exam online) — webcam, microphone, secure browser, stable internet |
|Prepared valid identification documents (required for check-in) |
|Planned arrival time or login time with at least 15 minutes of buffer |
|Gotten a good night of sleep the night before the exam |
|===

[TIP]
====
Treat the practice assessment as a diagnostic, not just a score. After completing it, review every question — including the ones you answered correctly. Understanding _why_ each answer is right (and why the others are wrong) deepens your mastery far more than simply checking whether you passed.
====



== Chapter Summary

* A structured study plan that allocates time based on exam domain weights and your personal knowledge gaps is the foundation of effective preparation. Candidates new to AI should plan for *15–20 hours* of study; those with prior experience may need *5–10 hours*.
* The exam interface includes a *progress bar, timer, navigation controls, and a review flag* feature. Familiarity with these elements before exam day reduces surprise and saves time.
* The *two-pass strategy* — answering confident questions first, then returning to flagged questions — is one of the most effective time-management techniques for a 45-minute, 40–60 question exam.
* Careful reading is critical. *Negative qualifiers* (not, except, least) and *scenario keywords* (bias, transparency, labeled data, bounding boxes) often determine the correct answer.
* The *process of elimination* improves guessing odds from 25% to 33%, 50%, or higher as you remove incorrect options. Look for absolute language, out-of-scope services, and retired features as elimination clues.
* Each of the five exam domains has characteristic *keyword patterns and common pitfalls*. Targeted review strategies for Responsible AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Generative AI help focus your final preparation.
* *Stress management* — including adequate sleep, controlled breathing, and disciplined answer-review habits — protects your performance from the negative effects of test anxiety.

You have now completed all nine chapters of this course. Return to xref:chapter-1.adoc#ch-1[Chapter 1]'s study schedule framework to assess your remaining preparation needs, and use the practice assessment linked in Additional Resources for a final readiness check.

== Review Questions

Test your understanding of the strategies and techniques covered in this chapter.

[arabic]
. *A candidate has no prior experience with AI or cloud computing. According to the guidelines in this chapter, approximately how many hours of study should they plan, and how should they distribute that time across the five exam domains?*
. *Describe the two-pass strategy for managing time during the AI-900 exam. Why is this approach more effective than spending unlimited time on each question in sequence?*
. *A practice question reads: "`Which of the following is _not_ a principle of Microsoft's responsible AI framework?`" A candidate selects "`Fairness`" because they recognize it as a responsible AI principle. Explain the error in the candidate's reasoning.*
. *You are down to two answer options on a question about identifying objects and their locations within an image. One option says "`image classification`" and the other says "`object detection.`" Using the keyword-spotting technique, which answer is correct, and what keyword in the question led you to that conclusion?*
. *Explain how the process of elimination changes your probability of guessing correctly on a four-option multiple-choice question. Provide the specific percentages.*
. *A scenario question describes a company that wants to analyze thousands of customer reviews to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Which Azure service or feature is most appropriate, and which exam domain does this question fall under?*
