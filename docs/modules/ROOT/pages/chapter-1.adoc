== What Is the AI-900 Certification?

The *Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals* certification — designated *AI-900* — is an entry-level credential that validates a candidate's understanding of core artificial intelligence (AI) concepts and how those concepts are implemented through Microsoft Azure cloud services.

Microsoft uses a numbering convention for its certification exams. Exams in the *900 series* are _fundamentals-level_, meaning they assume no prior technical expertise. The AI-900 sits alongside other fundamentals exams such as the AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) and DP-900 (Data Fundamentals). Together, these three exams form a broad introductory layer for anyone entering the Microsoft cloud ecosystem.

=== Key Characteristics of the AI-900

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Attribute |Detail
|*Level* |Fundamentals (entry-level)
|*Prerequisites* |None required
|*Technical coding required?* |No
|*Focus* |AI concepts {plus} Azure AI services
|*Audience* |Technical and non-technical professionals alike
|===

The AI-900 exam organizes AI capabilities into categories called _workloads_ — a term you will encounter frequently throughout this course.

== Why Pursue the AI-900?

=== Industry Recognition

Certifications serve as third-party validation of your knowledge. The AI-900 is recognized across industries as evidence that you understand foundational AI principles and can discuss how Azure supports AI solutions. For hiring managers evaluating candidates, a certification removes some of the guesswork — it signals that you have invested time in structured learning and met a defined performance standard.

=== The Growing AI Market

The AI industry is expanding rapidly. Analysts project that global spending on AI software will continue to grow at double-digit compound annual growth rates through the late 2020s. This growth is fueled by organizations across every sector — healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, education — adopting AI to automate processes, extract insights from data, and create new products and services.

As AI adoption accelerates, so does the need for professionals who understand it. This demand extends beyond engineers and data scientists. Business analysts, project managers, sales teams, and operations staff all benefit from AI literacy — and a credential like the AI-900 demonstrates that literacy.

=== Azure's Position in the Cloud Market

Microsoft Azure is one of the world's leading cloud platforms, competing alongside Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for market share. Azure's growth has been particularly strong in AI and machine learning services, fueled in part by Microsoft's strategic investment in OpenAI and the integration of large language models (AI systems trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language) into Azure's service offerings.

For professionals, this means that Azure-specific AI skills are directly applicable to a large and growing segment of the enterprise market.

=== Career and Salary Impact

.Figure 1.5: AI Career Salary Range Comparison

== Exam Content Domains

.Figure 1.1: AI-900 Exam Domain Weight Chart
image::ch1/visual_1_1_exam_domain_weights.png[Pie chart showing AI-900 exam domain weights: AI Workloads 15-20%; ML 20-25%; CV 15-20%; NLP 15-20%; GenAI 15-20%,width=70%]


The AI-900 exam is organized into five content domains, each weighted to indicate the approximate percentage of questions you can expect from that topic area. Microsoft may adjust these weights periodically, so always verify the current exam outline on the official Microsoft Learn website.

=== Domain Breakdown

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Domain |Weight (%) |Description
|*AI Workloads and Considerations* |15–20% |Types of AI workloads; responsible AI principles (fairness, reliability, safety, privacy, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability)
|*Machine Learning Principles on Azure* |20–25% |Core ML concepts (regression, classification, clustering, deep learning); datasets, features, labels; Azure Machine Learning capabilities
|*Computer Vision Workloads on Azure* |15–20% |Image classification, object detection, OCR, facial detection; Azure AI Vision and Azure AI Face services
|*NLP Workloads on Azure* |15–20% |Key phrase extraction, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, speech recognition/synthesis, translation; Azure AI Language and Azure AI Speech services
|*Generative AI Workloads on Azure* |15–20% |Generative AI concepts; generating text, code, and images; Azure OpenAI Service; responsible AI for generative models
|===

[.definition]
.Definition: workload
****
In the context of cloud computing and AI, a _workload_ refers to a specific set of tasks, processes, or operations that a system, application, or service performs. On the AI-900 exam, you will encounter this term frequently. Examples of AI workloads include training a machine learning model, performing image classification, or running a speech-to-text service.
****


To make these domains more concrete: Computer Vision powers systems that detect defects on manufacturing lines; NLP enables voice assistants like Cortana and Alexa; Machine Learning drives the recommendation engines behind platforms like Netflix and Amazon; and Generative AI produces the text completions and image generation capabilities found in tools like Microsoft Copilot.

=== Reading the Weights

Notice that Machine Learning Principles on Azure carries the highest weight at 20–25%. This tells you to allocate proportionally more study time to ML fundamentals. However, no domain should be neglected — even a 15% domain could make the difference between passing and failing.

[TIP]
====
Create a study schedule that allocates time to each domain roughly in proportion to its exam weight. Revisit the official exam skills outline at the start of your preparation to catch any recent changes.
====

|===

The 45-minute question period is embedded within a 65-minute appointment slot; the remaining time covers agreement acknowledgment, exam instructions, and optional post-exam feedback.

*Scaled scoring* means that a score of 700/1,000 does not necessarily correspond to answering exactly 70% of questions correctly. Microsoft adjusts scores to account for variations in exam difficulty across different question sets.

=== Delivery Options

You can take the AI-900 exam in one of two ways:

* *Online proctored:* Take the exam from home or office using a webcam and secure browser. You must meet technical and environmental requirements (quiet room, clear desk, stable internet).
* *Test center:* Sit the exam at an authorized Pearson VUE or Certiport testing location. Certiport is the typical option for students and educators. Students enrolled in academic programs (such as community college courses) typically register through Certiport, which may offer institutional pricing or voucher programs. Working professionals and independent learners generally register through Pearson VUE.

=== Registration and Cost

* *Registration fee:* Approximately $165 USD (may vary by region; discounts may be available through Microsoft events, educational institutions, or Microsoft Imagine Academy)
* *Registration platforms:* Pearson VUE or Certiport
* *Languages available:* English, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Korean, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and others

=== Breaks and Retake Policy

* *Breaks:* You may take unscheduled breaks, but the timer continues to run. Any questions you viewed before a break are locked — you cannot return to them. (Exam policies may be updated; review the current instructions provided at the start of your exam.)
* *First retake:* Available after a 24-hour waiting period (fee required again).
* *Subsequent retakes:* 14-day waiting period between attempts; maximum of five attempts within a 12-month period.
* *Accommodations:* Microsoft provides accommodations for candidates with documented disabilities (e.g., extended time, assistive technology). Requests must be submitted in advance with supporting documentation.

=== Certification Validity

The AI-900 certification does not expire on a fixed schedule. It remains valid as long as the associated technology and exam remain current. Microsoft may retire or update exams over time, so monitor official announcements.

[TIP]
====
Before moving on, can you recall the passing score, the approximate number of questions, and the time limit for the AI-900 exam without looking back? Test yourself, then verify your answers above.
