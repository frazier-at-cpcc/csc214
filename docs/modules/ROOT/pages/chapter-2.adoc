== 2.1 What Are Azure AI Services?

Microsoft Azure provides a collection of cloud-based tools known as *Azure AI Services*. These services allow developers to embed intelligent features — such as language understanding, image analysis, speech processing, and content generation — into web and mobile applications without building machine learning models from scratch.

The defining characteristic of Azure AI Services is that they are *prebuilt and pretrained*. Microsoft has invested years of research into creating machine learning models that solve common AI tasks. Rather than requiring you to collect data, train a model, and deploy it yourself, Azure AI Services expose ready-to-use capabilities through simple interfaces. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry: organizations of any size can integrate AI into their products without maintaining a team of machine learning specialists.

While many of these services work immediately with no additional configuration, some — such as Azure AI Vision, Azure AI Speech, and Azure OpenAI Service — also support *fine-tuning* with custom data. This flexibility means you can start with a general-purpose model and later adapt it to meet domain-specific requirements.

.Definition: Azure AI Services
****
A collection of prebuilt, cloud-hosted AI capabilities offered by Microsoft Azure. These services cover areas such as vision, speech, language, decision-making, and generative AI, and they can be consumed through REST APIs, SDKs, or graphical studio interfaces.

== 2.2 The Microsoft Azure Platform

Before diving deeper into the AI-specific services, it helps to understand the broader platform on which they run.

=== 2.2.1 Azure at a Glance

Microsoft Azure is one of the world's leading cloud computing platforms. It offers more than 200 services spanning compute, storage, networking, databases, analytics, AI, and more. Azure operates across dozens of geographic regions worldwide, giving organizations the ability to deploy applications close to their users for improved performance and regulatory compliance. (For the current count, visit the Azure global infrastructure page.)

.Definition: Cloud Computing
****
The delivery of computing services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, and AI — over the internet, enabling on-demand scalability and pay-as-you-go pricing.
****


=== 2.2.2 Deployment Environments

.Figure 2.5: Azure AI Deployment Environments
image::ch2/visual_2_5_deployment_environments.png[Three-panel illustration showing Cloud; On-Premises; and Edge deployment environments,width=85%]


Azure supports three primary deployment environments. The AI-900 exam expects you to understand these at a conceptual level.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Environment |Description |Example Use Case
|*Cloud* |Resources run on Microsoft-managed remote servers. Users access services over the internet and can scale up or down on demand without managing physical hardware. |A startup deploys an AI-powered chatbot that automatically scales during peak traffic hours.
|*On-premises* |Azure services run on an organization's own local servers. The organization manages the physical infrastructure. |A hospital processes patient records locally to satisfy strict data residency regulations.
|*Edge* |Data is processed close to where it is generated, often on IoT devices or in locations with limited connectivity. This reduces latency and bandwidth costs. |A manufacturing plant runs quality-inspection AI on cameras at the assembly line rather than sending video to a remote data center.
|===

.Definition: Edge Computing
****
A computing paradigm in which data processing occurs near the source of the data — such as on a sensor, gateway, or local device — rather than in a centralized cloud data center. Edge computing reduces latency and can operate even when network connectivity is intermittent.
****


.Definition: Internet of Things (IoT)
****
A network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data. Edge computing is closely associated with IoT deployments.
****


.Definition: On-Premises Deployment
****
A deployment model in which software and infrastructure are hosted within an organization's own physical facilities rather than in a third-party cloud environment.
****


.Reflection
****
Consider an organization you are familiar with — a workplace, a school, or a business you patronize. Which deployment environment (cloud, on-premises, or edge) would best suit its needs, and why?
****



[[sec-2-3]]
== 2.3 Setting Up an Azure Account

To work with Azure AI Services, you need an Azure account. Microsoft offers several options that make it easy to get started at no cost.

=== 2.3.1 Free Account

New users can sign up at https://azure.microsoft.com[azure.microsoft.com] for a free account. The free trial typically includes:

* A credit (amount varies by region and promotional period; verify at azure.microsoft.com/free) to explore any Azure service during the first 30 days
* Free access to a selection of popular services for the first 12 months, subject to usage limits
* More than 55 services that remain free indefinitely, as long as usage stays within specified caps

=== 2.3.2 Student Account

Students can sign up for *Azure for Students*, which provides free credits (amount varies; verify at azure.microsoft.com/free/students) for 12 months without requiring a credit card. This is an excellent option for learners in academic programs.

=== 2.3.3 Pay-As-You-Go

After the free trial or student plan expires, Azure operates on a *pay-as-you-go* billing model. You pay only for the resources you consume, and there is no long-term contract. Azure also provides cost-management tools, budget alerts, and a pricing calculator to help you monitor spending.

.Definition: Pay-As-You-Go
****
A billing model in which customers are charged only for the Azure resources they consume, with no long-term commitment required.
****


[TIP]
====
For the purposes of this course and AI-900 exam preparation, the free or student account tiers will provide sufficient access to experiment with Azure AI Services. Always monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.

== 2.4 Navigating the Azure Portal

.Figure 2.1: Azure Portal Dashboard
image::ch2/visual_2_1_azure_portal.png[Annotated screenshot of the Azure portal showing search bar; service shortcuts; and resource sections,width=85%]


The *Azure portal* is a web-based management console where you can create, configure, and monitor all of your Azure resources.

=== 2.4.1 Portal Layout

When you log in at https://portal.azure.com[portal.azure.com], you will see a dashboard that includes:

* *Service shortcuts* — Quick-access icons for frequently used services such as creating resources, managing virtual machines, and accessing AI services
* *Search bar* — A universal search tool at the top of the page for locating any Azure service or resource by name
* *Resources section* — A panel showing recent and favorite resources, making it easy to return to ongoing projects
* *More services link* — A gateway to the full catalog of Azure's 200{plus} services

The portal is designed to be intuitive and customizable. You can pin frequently used services to your dashboard and rearrange tiles to suit your workflow.

.Definition: Azure Portal
****
The web-based graphical interface provided by Microsoft for managing Azure subscriptions, resources, and services. It is accessible at portal.azure.com.

[[sec-2-5]]
== 2.5 Creating an Azure AI Resource

Before you can use any Azure AI Service, you must create a *resource* — a manageable item within Azure that represents an instance of a service.

.Definition: Azure Resource
****
A manageable item in Azure that represents an instance of a service, such as a Computer Vision service or a storage account. Resources are organized within resource groups.
****


=== 2.5.1 Two Types of Resources

.Figure 2.2: Multiservice vs. Single-Service Resource Comparison
image::ch2/visual_2_2_multiservice_vs_single.png[Diagram comparing multiservice resource with single endpoint to separate single-service resources with individual endpoints,width=85%]


Azure gives you two approaches for provisioning AI resources:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Resource Type |Description |Best For
|*Multiservice resource* |A single resource that provides access to multiple Azure AI Services through one key and one endpoint. Billing is consolidated. |Exploring several services at once; projects that combine vision, language, and speech capabilities.
|*Single-service resource* |A dedicated resource for one specific Azure AI Service. Each service receives its own key and endpoint. |Tracking usage and costs for a particular service independently; production deployments where isolation is important.
|===

.Definition: Endpoint
****
A URL that serves as the access point where your application connects to interact with an Azure service. Each resource you create is assigned a unique endpoint.
****


.Definition: API Key
****
A unique identifier used to authenticate requests to an Azure AI Service. When you create a resource, Azure generates keys that your application must include in its requests to prove it has permission to use the service.
****


=== 2.5.2 Steps to Create a Resource

.Figure 2.7: Azure AI Resource Creation Workflow
image::ch2/visual_2_7_resource_creation.png[Six-step flowchart for creating an Azure AI resource,width=85%]


The most straightforward method for creating an Azure AI resource is through the Azure portal:

[arabic]
. Sign in to the Azure portal
. Select *Create a resource*
. In the marketplace search bar, enter "`Azure AI Services`" for a multiservice resource, or search for the specific service name (e.g., "`AI Vision,`" "`AI Language,`" "`AI Face`") for a single-service resource. (The specific services you can provision — such as AI Vision or AI Language — are explored in later chapters. For now, selecting "`Azure AI Services`" as a multiservice resource is the recommended starting point.)
. Select the desired service and click *Create*
. Fill in the required configuration fields (described below)
. Review your settings and click *Create* to provision the resource

=== 2.5.3 Configuration Fields

.Figure 2.8: Azure Resource Configuration Fields
image::ch2/visual_2_8_resource_config.png[Annotated form mockup showing subscription; resource group; region; name; and pricing tier fields,width=85%]


When creating a resource, you will need to provide the following information:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Purpose
|*Subscription* |The billing account that will be charged for this resource. A *subscription* is the billing and access agreement under which Azure resources are created and charged. Your free or student account includes a default subscription that determines which services you can access and how usage is billed.
|*Resource group* |A logical container used to organize and manage related Azure resources together. You can select an existing group or create a new one.
|*Region* |The geographic location of the data center where the resource will be hosted. Choosing a region close to your users reduces latency.
|*Name* |A unique, descriptive name that identifies this resource (e.g., "`my-vision-service`").
|*Pricing tier* |The service level that determines available features, performance limits, and cost. Many services offer a free tier with limited usage.
|===

.Definition: Resource Group
****
A logical container in Azure that holds related resources for an application or project. Resource groups help you organize, manage, and control access to collections of resources as a single unit.
****


.Reflection
****
Imagine you are building an application that needs to analyze customer reviews (text) and also scan product photos for defects (images). Would you choose a multiservice resource or two single-service resources? What factors would influence your decision?
****



[[sec-2-6]]
== 2.6 Accessing Azure AI Services

.Figure 2.4: Three Methods for Accessing Azure AI Services
image::ch2/visual_2_4_access_methods.png[Three-column comparison of REST API; SDK; and Studio access methods,width=85%]


Once you have created a resource, there are three primary ways to interact with Azure AI Services.

=== 2.6.1 REST APIs

.Figure 2.3: REST API Request/Response Flow
image::ch2/visual_2_3_rest_api_flow.png[Flow diagram showing application sending HTTP request with API key to Azure AI endpoint and receiving JSON response,width=85%]


A *REST API* (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized way for software applications to communicate over the internet using HTTP requests. Azure AI Services expose REST endpoints that accept requests (typically containing data such as text or images) and return structured responses (typically in JSON format).

Think of a REST API as a digital bridge: your application sends a request to the Azure endpoint, the AI service processes the input, and the service sends back a result. This is the same pattern used when a weather application retrieves the latest forecast from a weather data provider, or when an airline website checks seat availability from its reservation system.

=== 2.6.2 SDKs

*Software Development Kits (SDKs)* are packages of libraries, tools, and documentation that simplify the process of building applications for a specific platform. Microsoft provides Azure AI SDKs for popular programming languages, including Python, C#, Java, and JavaScript. SDKs wrap REST API calls in convenient functions, reducing the amount of code you need to write.

Think of an SDK as a pre-assembled toolkit. If the REST API is the raw connection point (like a standard electrical outlet), the SDK is the appliance's power adapter — it handles the specific translation and wiring so you can connect without worrying about low-level details.

=== 2.6.3 Studio Interfaces

For users who want to explore AI capabilities without writing code, Azure provides web-based *studio* environments. These graphical tools are covered in detail in the next section.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Access Method |Requires Coding? |Best For
|*REST API* |Yes |Maximum flexibility; integration into any application that supports HTTP
|*SDK* |Yes |Streamlined development in a specific programming language
|*Studio* |No |Exploration, demos, prototyping, and evaluation without code
|===

.Definition: REST API
****
A set of rules and conventions that allow software applications to communicate over the internet. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to exchange data, typically in JSON format.
****


.Definition: SDK (Software Development Kit)
****
A collection of tools, libraries, sample code, and documentation provided to developers to simplify building applications for a particular platform or service.
****


[TIP]
====
For the AI-900 exam, you do not need to know how to write code that calls these APIs or SDKs. However, you should understand what APIs and SDKs are, how they are used conceptually, and that studios offer a no-code alternative.
====


[TIP]
====
A data scientist comfortable with Python wants to automate image analysis across thousands of files. A marketing manager with no coding experience wants to test whether AI can caption product photos. Which access method would best suit each person, and why?

== 2.7 Azure AI Studios

.Figure 2.6: Azure AI Studios Overview
image::ch2/visual_2_6_azure_ai_studios.png[Hub-and-spoke diagram showing Azure AI Foundry connected to Vision; Language; Speech; and Content Safety Studios,width=85%]


Azure provides several specialized *studio* environments that offer graphical, browser-based interfaces for working with AI Services. Studios are particularly valuable for beginners and for rapid prototyping, because they allow you to upload data, experiment with different AI capabilities, and view results — all without writing a single line of code.

=== 2.7.1 Overview of Studios

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Studio |Primary Focus
|*Vision Studio* |Image and video analysis — including object detection, image classification, optical character recognition (OCR), and image captioning
|*Language Studio* |Text-based AI — including sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language translation, and text summarization; tools for building custom language models
|*Speech Studio* |Speech-to-text transcription, text-to-speech synthesis, and real-time speech translation; useful for building applications with voice interaction
|*Content Safety Studio* |Detection and moderation of harmful content such as hate speech, violence, and other inappropriate material; used to establish content safeguards
|===

=== 2.7.2 Azure AI Foundry

In addition to the individual studios listed above, Microsoft offers *Azure AI Foundry* (formerly known as *Azure AI Studio*). Azure AI Foundry is a unified, web-based platform that brings together multiple Azure AI Services, APIs, and models in a single environment. Developers can use it to design, build, and deploy AI applications that draw on a combination of capabilities — for example, an application that uses both language understanding and generative AI.

.Definition: Azure AI Foundry
****
A unified, web-based development platform (formerly called Azure AI Studio) that combines multiple Azure AI Services, APIs, and models. It enables developers to create end-to-end AI applications from a single environment.
****


=== 2.7.3 Using a Studio: A Walkthrough

To illustrate how studios work, consider the following example using Vision Studio:

[arabic]
. In the Azure portal, search for *Computer Vision* and create a Computer Vision resource (filling in subscription, resource group, region, name, and pricing tier)
. After the resource is provisioned, navigate to *Vision Studio*
. From the Vision Studio dashboard, select a capability — such as *Add captions to images*
. Upload an image or select a sample image provided by Microsoft
. The AI service analyzes the image and generates a descriptive caption

This entire workflow requires no programming. The studio handles the API calls behind the scenes and presents results in a visual interface. You can experiment with other features — such as extracting text from images (OCR), detecting objects, or identifying faces — using the same straightforward process.

.Reflection
****
Studios provide a no-code way to experiment with AI. How might a product manager or business analyst use a studio to evaluate whether a particular AI capability is worth integrating into their company's application?
****



[[sec-2-8]]
== 2.8 How Azure AI Services Connect to the AI-900 Exam

The AI-900 exam tests your understanding of Azure AI Services at a *conceptual* level. You are not expected to demonstrate deep technical skills such as writing API calls, configuring network security, or debugging deployment pipelines. Instead, the exam focuses on:

* Knowing what the major Azure AI Services are and what problems they solve
* Understanding how resources are provisioned and managed
* Recognizing the role of endpoints, keys, APIs, and SDKs
* Identifying the appropriate studio or service for a given scenario
* Understanding deployment options (cloud, on-premises, edge)

The topics introduced in this chapter — Azure AI Services, resource creation, access methods, and studios — form the foundation for the more detailed service-specific discussions that follow in subsequent units. For instance, Unit 3 will explore machine learning on Azure in greater depth, Unit 4 will cover computer vision workloads, and Unit 5 will address natural language processing.

[TIP]
====
As you study, focus on understanding _what_ each service does and _when_ you would use it, rather than memorizing technical implementation details. The AI-900 rewards conceptual clarity over hands-on technical depth.
====
