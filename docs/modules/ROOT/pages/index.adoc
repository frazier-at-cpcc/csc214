:revdate: Spring 2026

This textbook was developed as an Open Educational Resource for CSC-214: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at Central Piedmont Community College. It is designed to prepare students for the *Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)* certification exam while building a genuine understanding of artificial intelligence concepts.

The AI-900 certification validates foundational knowledge of AI workloads and how they are implemented on Microsoft Azure. It is an entry-level credential that requires no programming experience or advanced mathematics -- making it accessible to students from all backgrounds and career paths.

== How This Book Is Organized

This book is organized into four parts that mirror the progression of learning from foundational concepts through exam-day readiness:

=== Part I: Foundations

Introduces the AI-900 certification and the Azure platform. These two chapters orient you to what the exam covers, why it matters, and how Azure AI services are structured.

== How to Use This Book

Each chapter follows a consistent structure designed for effective learning:

* *Learning Objectives* at the start of each chapter tell you exactly what you should be able to do after studying the material.
* *Key Terms* are defined in context and collected in a glossary table at the end of each chapter.
* *Admonition blocks* (Notes, Tips, and Important callouts) highlight exam-critical information, study strategies, and common misconceptions.
* *Visual diagrams and figures* throughout each chapter illustrate concepts that are difficult to grasp from text alone.
* *Review Questions* at the end of each chapter test your understanding and encourage active recall.

For the best results, study the chapters in order, attempt the review questions without looking back at the text, and revisit the domain-specific review strategies in Chapter 9 during your final preparation week.
