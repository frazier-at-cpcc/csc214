== Appendix D: Exam Day Checklist

Print or bookmark this page for the day of your exam.

*One Week Before*::
[ ] Review all chapter summaries and key terms +
[ ] Complete the Microsoft Learn practice assessment +
[ ] Identify your weakest domain and study it specifically +
[ ] Confirm your exam appointment details (time, location or system requirements)

*The Night Before*::
[ ] Review the keyword-to-concept mapping (Chapter 9, Section 9.4.3) +
[ ] Review the Responsible AI principles one final time +
[ ] Set alarms with buffer time +
[ ] Get a full night of sleep

*Exam Day*::
[ ] Eat a light meal and hydrate +
[ ] Arrive or log in 15 minutes early +
[ ] For online exams: close all applications, clear your desk, test your webcam and internet +
[ ] For test centers: bring two forms of valid ID

*During the Exam*::
[ ] Read each question completely before looking at the answers +
[ ] Watch for negative qualifiers: _not_, _except_, _least_ +
[ ] Use the two-pass strategy: answer confident questions first, flag uncertain ones +
[ ] Check pacing at 15 minutes (1/3 done), 30 minutes (2/3 done), 40 minutes (all answered) +
[ ] Use process of elimination on every uncertain question +
[ ] Breathe. You prepared for this.
